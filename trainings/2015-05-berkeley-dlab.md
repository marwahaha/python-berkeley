<!-- title: Berkeley D-Lab -- May 2015 -->


# Potential instructors

Currently, this training is being organized here (via pull requests), and on the
related [issue on the github
tracker](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/issues/37).

Below is an incomplete schematic of what the course will approximately look like,
instructors for each day. Again, I'd like to have a short party at the end.

A sign-up page still needs to be made on the D-Lab site.

## Getting ready

We'll use the most recent version of BCE for VirtualBox. Links and instructions
are [here](http://bce.berkeley.edu/install.html). While it's a bit sharp-edged,
we'll use the most recent [Summer Preview
version](https://berkeley.box.com/s/0hibyy77ojyv6v1ybynioz44htwzs99v), along
with the most recent version of
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

And, while you're looking ahead to our training, check out our [Learning
Resources](learning_resources.html).

## Agenda and Instructors

Please note that the class will proceed at the pace of the students. Topics
below are meant as guidelines, and are not guaranteed!

### Friday, Jan 16

Instructor: @davclark

 - [Etherpad for Python day
   5](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-05-dlab-fundamentals-5)
 - Working with tabular data, standard library vs.  Pandas (the [standard
   documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.16.1/) is a bit
   tough, so I'd recommend [this
   book](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592))
 - For plotting, the place to start is
   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html), but
   [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) looks nicer by
   default (matplotlib is also covered well in the above-mentioned
   [book](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592)).
 - [Scrape the web](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/)
 - Dav's current project to [scrape the CA Dept. of
   Ed.](https://github.com/davclark/LEA-scrapr)
 - Saving time with [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)

## Join The Community!

We keep track of our *Friday 2:30-4:30pm Social Computing meetings* on our [mailing
list](https://www.mail-archive.com/socialcomputing@lists.berkeley.edu).
**We won't have a meeting right after the Friday class, but join the mailing
list! (look in the sidebar, or above on mobile/narrow browsers).**

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar, along with our
sister organization, The Hacker Within, are also available in the side bar at
the right. All are welcome! Sometimes there are better resources (like [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just Google), but the Berkeley
Python community is always happy to get you moving in the right direction.
