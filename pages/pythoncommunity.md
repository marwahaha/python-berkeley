### The Hacker Within 
THW is a weekly meeting about scientific computing.
The Hacker Within supports the development of your inner hacker, in a [weekly meeting in BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu/about/directions-and-travel) for sharing skills and best practices for scientific computation. You can find out more on their website: [http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/)


### Learn Python Working Group
You are on our page! We meet weekly at the D-Lab. We hold informal weekly meetings teaching and learning about different topics in the Python programming language, especially for social science, data science, and visualization. You can [subscribe to our mailing list here](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/learnpython@lists.berkeley.edu). 



### py4science
The py4science mailing list is still functional. This is a general campus discussion and announcement list for Python. [Subscribe here!](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/py4science@lists.berkeley.edu)

### Data Science Resource List
[This is a listing of data science groups](http://marwahaha.github.io/datamap/support) at UC Berkeley, where you can get help.

### Prior groups

Social Computing and the Python Work Party were groups that were active in the
past in D-Lab.  **Social Computing** [used its mailing list archive as its
