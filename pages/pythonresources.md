## Asking questions

The best place to ask questions is probably [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), but they like you to ask what they have
decided are "good questions" there. Please take the time to read the ["tour" for
Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tour), or this more in-depth [essay on
asking good questions by Eric
Raymond](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) - note that Eric DOES
NOT want questions from anyone (unless he finds them in a forum)! Note also that
the Berkeley Python community is pretty friendly, and you're always welcome to
check with us on the mailing list.

## Zero-installation intros

These resources include an integrated python interpreter that
works through your web browser. To use the other resources, you'll
need to get access to a python interpreter (described in the next
section).

 - [Try Python](https://try-python.appspot.com/)
 - [Codecademy Python Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
 - [learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/)
 - [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com)

## Intro materials on GitHub

 - [Dav's D-Lab materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals)
 - [Omoju's Hip Hop / Turtle curriculum](https://github.com/davclark/ultra_scrapr)

## Getting Python

Simple consoles: [PySchools](http://doc.pyschools.com/console) and [Codecademy
Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com)

The **easy** way, hosted IPython in your browser: [Wakari.io](http://wakari.io)

If you are using OS X or Linux (or similar), you likely already have Python
installed. You can just run `python` from the command line. (If you don't know
how to run things from the command line, it's probably easiest to start with the
Wakari link above, so you only have one thing to learn! If you want more of a
power-user experience then you can start with the [Command Line Crash
Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).)

If you install Python, you should follow [the instructions on
the IPython page](http://ipython.org/install.html). (IPython is an enhanced shell for Python.)

## Other online tutorials

 - [Tutorial from the official Python website](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/)
 - [Other resources are available on the Python wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)

   notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming/master/notebooks/intro_programming_index.ipynb)

## Video tutorials
 - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython)
 - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/computer-science)

## Cheat Sheets

 - [A simple reference](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~destem/gamedev/python.pdf)
 - [A dense, compact reference](http://sleet.aos.wisc.edu/~gpetty/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Python_qr.pdf)
 - [A long format reference](http://new.math.uiuc.edu/math198/repo/math198/week3/SturtPythonReference.pdf)

## E-books

 - [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html)
 - [6 Free ebooks for python](http://readwrite.com/2011/03/25/python-is-an-increasingly-popu)
 - [Python for Data Analysis](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592)
   (a great intro to real scientific computing with Python)
 - [Intermediate Python](http://book.pythontips.com)
 - At Berkeley, we have access to the following e-book catalogs (which includes the Data Analysis book above):
    - [O'Reilly Safari Bookshelf](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/)
    - [Springer Link](http://link.springer.com/search?facet-content-type=%22Book%22)

## Other topics

A general resource when you're exploring new topics is the [Hitchhiker's Guide
to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/). (Just like this site, you
can [contribute to the Hitchhiker's Guide via
GitHub](https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide).)

Head over to [Full Stack Python](http://fullstackpython.com/) to learn how to write and deploy Python-based web applications using popular frameworks such as [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

[Python for Data Analysis](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592) is a great place to get started.
Or, you can learn about these tools from their websites:

 - [Pandas for reading / manipulating data](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html) (the most common graphing library, includes a great
   [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html))

And then look here for inspiration:

 - [View existing IPython notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)
 - [A list of other interesting IPython notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

# At Berkeley
UC Berkeley has a lot of great resources for learning scientific computing and
data science.  There are classes, tutorials, reading groups, institutes, and
much more.  Below are some things worth checking out:

## Scientific computing resources at UC Berkeley
- [The D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)
- [The I-school masters in data science](http://datascience.berkeley.edu)
- [The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (more details soon)](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience/bids-launch-dec-12)
- [The Berkeley VC for research page on data science](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience)
- [The Open Computing Facility](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/), which provides
  free access to highly-performant servers with Python, IPython, and related
  tools to all members of the UC Berkeley community. OCF volunteers also
  maintain [a Python library](https://github.com/ocf/ocflib) for interacting
  with university resources like LDAP and CAS.

## Python Courses at UC Berkeley
- [CS9H](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/class/cs9h/index.shtml) - Self-paced Python course. Requires some programming background. Good for people that know another language and want to pick up Python.
- [AY250](http://profjsb.github.io/python-seminar/) - "Python computing for science." More advanced python course for scientists.
- [AY98](http://ugastro.berkeley.edu/pydecal/)- "Python Programming for Astronomers". Introductory python course with an emphasis on applications to astronomy.

## Intensives

Software carpentry offers a variety of trainings around the world, check their
[main site](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html) for bootcamp
dates.
