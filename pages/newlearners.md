## For New Learners
Here is a great list of resources when getting started with Python:

#### Start here!
[Start with this 10-minute tutorial.](https://try-python.appspot.com/) When it loads, type ```tutorial``` and press Enter to start.

{% highlight python %}
def hi():
    print("hello world")
{% endhighlight %}


## Set up your computer
This is our recommended way to install Python on your system.

#### Install Jupyter
With Jupyter, you intersperse code and text in one big file called a &#34;notebook&#34;. It is very convenient to write code, test, and visualize results. Highly recommended for research use.

* Please [install Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads). If your lab does not have a preference, I use Python 3.
* Open the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows), and type ```conda install jupyter```. Follow the installation procedures.
* To run, open the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type ```jupyter notebook```. When it&#39;s loaded, click on &#34;New&#34; (at the top right) to create a new notebook.

Please [email](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) if you have any installation issues.

#### Plaintext editor
Sublime Text is recommended, which you can [download here](http://sublimetext.com/).

#### Python 2 vs Python 3
Python 3 (released in 2008) is the newest version of Python, and most features have not changed. Most packages have been updated to Python 3 by now (2016). So, if your lab does not have a preference, I recommend using Python 3. 

There are a couple key differences for novice programmers:

* In Python 2, you can print with ```print 42``` or ```print(42)```. In Python 3, you need to use parentheses, like in ```print(42)```.
* In Python 2, division of two integers like ```5/2``` will evaluate to ```2```. (Python will drop the remainder if both numbers are integers.) Python 3 does exact division (in this example, ```2.5```). 
	* If you use Python 2 and do not want this behavior, add this line at the top of each program: ```from __future__ import division```.
