Come on **Monday, March 7 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will work with the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) library in Python to read external data, conduct analysis, and do some plotting. This is the Excel equivalent in Python --- and you&#39;ll be surprised of its possibilities!

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). Also, we&#39;d love if you can go through [these exercises](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.html). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.
