Come on **Monday, February 22 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will dive into the Jupyter Notebook and explore some of Python&#39;s fundamentals. There will be time for discussion and about other workflows that people use Python. No prior experience necessary!

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.
