# Welcome

Here is a collection of resources about the [Python programming language](https://python.org/) and its use on the UC Berkeley campus. Please check out the [Community](/community) and [Learning Resources](/resources) pages, and do contribute if you can.

## Want to Learn Python?

Learn Python is a working group on the UC Berkeley campus, sponsored by the D-Lab. We hold informal weekly meetings teaching and learning about different topics in the Python programming language, especially for social science, data science, and visualization. 

This is ideal for learners who are new to Python --- you&#39;ll have a group of peers instead of being by yourself. If you&#39;re a little more advanced, you can try to teach something. You are welcome to attend any or all meetings throughout the semester.

On this website, you can check out or improve our [beginner resources](/learn). We also have a list of topics from [past meetings](/past). Please [send an email](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or join us on **Mondays from 5-6:30pm** at D-Lab (**356 Barrows Hall, UC Berkeley**). The [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu) also offers many other free computing resources for academics, including workshops and 1-on-1 consulting.

We have a mailing list! You can [subscribe here](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/learnpython@lists.berkeley.edu).
